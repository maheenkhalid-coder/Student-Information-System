PORJECT: "Student Information System"

So here it is my project details and features:

Student Information System (SIS) is software designed to introduce a conducive and structured information exchange environment for integrating students, teachers, and the administration of a school or college. Software systems enable educational institutions to supervise student-related activities such as keeping student information, courses information and update their records.

Main Features:

Student Information System provides us five main features that make this project unique and more useful for collecting information from the students. 
It manages student information efficiently, records student details like name, roll number, address, email address, etc.  
Add, Update and Delete(CRUD) module, student information, and trace student record through this software very easily.

For achieving these following objectives I prefer to use linear data structure which means I use ARRAY's to store all the data:

* Add Student Information.
* Add Course Information.
* Record Student Information in an array.
* View Student information record.
* Search specific Student information.
* Delete specific Student information.
* Delete and shift data in an array.
* Use switch statements.
* Use do-while loop.
* Exit.

I hope you like the working idea about this project.
